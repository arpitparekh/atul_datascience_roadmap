## Different Between Lesso and Linear Regression

make button:


1. Linear regression is like drawing a straight line through your data points that best fits them. It tries to predict an outcome by creating a simple equation using all your input features (variables).
2. LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) is like linear regression but with a special feature - it can automatically remove or reduce the impact of less important variables by setting their coefficients to zero or close to zero. Think of it as a "feature selector" that helps identify which variables are most important for making predictions.
A simple analogy:

1. Linear regression is like a chef using all ingredients available, regardless of how much they actually contribute to the dish's taste
2. LASSO is like a chef who tastes the dish and removes ingredients that don't add much flavor, making the recipe simpler and more focused

#### The main benefits of LASSO:

Simpler models (fewer variables)
Reduces overfitting (when a model is too complex and fits noise in the data)
Helps identify which features are most important

Would you like me to explain any specific aspect of these methods in more detail?
